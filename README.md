# Interview Simulator AI

Welcome to the Interview Simulator AI project! This open-source project aims to create an interactive platform for simulating job interviews using AI technologies. The application is built with Django and Python, utilizing OpenAI's ML models for natural language processing. Additionally, it incorporates Google's voice-to-text and text-to-voice models for a seamless user experience.
